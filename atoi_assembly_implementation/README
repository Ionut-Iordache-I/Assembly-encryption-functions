In the atoi_func file I implemented the similar functionality of the atoi function in C: int iocla_atoi (char * token).
In the main function I added on the stack string_buffer which is the address where the string I want to convert to type int is located.
In the atoi_f function, I initially kept the string in edx, after which I transformed each character in this string into the number that
I added to the final number to create the number that results from the string as original atoi function implementation does.
I kept the final result in the eax register which I displayed both as int and as hexa. 

How to see if it works ?
Type in the console as it follows:
make build
./atoi_func
make clear
